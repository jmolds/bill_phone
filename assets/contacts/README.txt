This directory contains profile images for Bill's trusted contacts.

In a production environment, you should:
1. Replace these placeholder images with actual photos of Bill's contacts
2. Make sure photos are clear, well-lit, and easily recognizable
3. Crop photos to be square (1:1 aspect ratio) for best display
4. Use high-quality images (at least 300x300 pixels)
5. Consider accessibility - faces should be clearly visible against backgrounds

For privacy reasons, actual contact photos should only be added to the production build
by the primary caregiver or family member responsible for Bill's device.
